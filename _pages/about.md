<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a assistant researcher at Westlake University, Hangzhou, China (西湖大学). From 2022 to 2024, I was a Postdoctor with Westlake University, Hangzhou, China, supervised by Prof. Xiaofei Li (李晓飞). 
I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2022, supervised by Prof. Hong Liu (刘宏). I received the B.Eng. degree in automation from the University Of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2015. 

My research interests include sound source localization and tracking, and multichannel audio representation learning.
